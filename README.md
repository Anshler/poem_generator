# Vietnamese Poem Generation & The Prospect Of Cross-Language Poem-To-Poem Translation

Poetry generation has been a challenging task in the field of Natural Language Processing, as it requires
the model to understand the nuances of language, sentiment, and style. Our proposed system will use
Language Model and deep learning techniques to generate poems from natural language prompt that is
both intuitive and offers greater control over the generated content. The model will be trained on a large
corpus of poems written in a Vietnamese language, and will be evaluated using custom metrics tailtored
specifically for Vietnamese poem

Our team hopes that the results of this research will contribute to the ongoing efforts to advance the
field of AI-generated poetry, especially in Vietnamese, and have potential applications in creative writing,
education, and entertainment.
