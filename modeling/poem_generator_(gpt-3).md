# MODELS INFO
### Currently we don't have access to our poem generator models on openai since we exceeded our quota (trial account). 

For context, we had 4 models, Davinci-003 and 3 Baggage at diferent sample size and dataset. With ChatGPT for comparison.

- Davinci-003 was train on 500 samples at 2 epochs (equal 1000).
- prompt-to-poem Baggage was train on 20000 and 50000 samples (same dataset).
- paragraph-to-poem Babbage was train on the same number of 'luc bat' poems as the 50000 dataset, but with descriptive input instead of request input.

### You just have to trust what we say :)
